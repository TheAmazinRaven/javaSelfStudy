Exercise 1

Create a two dimensional array with 12 "rows" & 2 "columns." The first column will correspond to a month of the year such as January - 1 and December - 12. The second column will be revenue that a lemonade stand makes in that month. Load the array with the following information.

Jan = $34
Feb = $44
Mar = $23
Apr = $76
May = $65
Jun = $98
Jul = $123
Aug = $102
Sept = $87
Oct = $43
Nov = $34
Dec = $12
